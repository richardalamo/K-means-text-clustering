The objective of this project was to perform text clustering on the popular dataset, "Twenty News Group," obtained from [https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html).

Text clustering is a subfield of unsupervised machine learning that involves grouping together similar textual data into clusters. This technique has several significant applications, here are some popular ones:

- **News Aggregation**: Groups similar news stories together for easy discovery and follow-up.
- **Social Media Analysis**: Clusters similar social media posts or comments for trend monitoring and identifying related content.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Categorizes similar customer reviews or feedback for identifying common problems or praise points.
- **Email Filtering**: Helps classify similar emails, streamlining user inboxes.
- **Search Engine Optimization**: Clusters similar search queries together, providing insights for content optimization.
